# A Valentine's Odyssey

Play as a **Valentine Arrow**! The sprites were created using **Canva**. It is four days before Valentine's Day when I created this project, that's why it is Valentine's related. Since, I do not have any idea at all what to do; I just went to the theme of the nearest special event when I made this. It is not the best game, I know:)

I am really looking forward to recreate this when I'm better at programming in general, resembling the mechanics of this game but altered just a bit...

**Play it at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/801780093**

## CONTROLS:
- Use the arrow keys to control your arrow.
> To go up, use the  **↑** button

> To go down, use the  **↓** button

> To go right, use the **→** button

> To go left, use the **←** button

## MECHANICS:
- Ensure that you aim for the heart that's running away. 
- Each time your arrow hits the heart, you receive **1 point**.
- It is practically **endless**.
 
**_Earn as many points as possible!_**

**If you wanted a challenge, set a timer to a specific time length and test out how many points would you score in that time frame. Then, challenge yourself or others to beat your score in the same time frame. Goodluck!**

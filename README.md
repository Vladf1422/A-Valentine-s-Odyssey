# A Valentine's Odyssey

Play as a **_Valentine Arrow_**! The sprites were created using **Canva**. It is four days before Valentine's Day when I created this project, that's why it is Valentine's related. Since, I do not have any idea at all what to do; I just went to the theme of the nearest special event when I made this. It is not the best game, I know:)

I am really looking forward to recreate this when I'm better at programming in general; resembling the mechanics of this game but altered just a bit...

## GAMERULE:
- Use the arrow keys to control your arrow.
> To go up, use the  **↑** button

> To go down, use the  **↓** button

> To go right, use the **→** button

> To go left, use the **←** button


- Ensure that you aim for the heart that's running away. 
- Each time your arrow hits the heart, you receive 1 point.
 
**_Earn as many points as possible!_**
